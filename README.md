# ðŸŒ€ Gravity Manipulation Prototype

A Unity-based 3D puzzle prototype where players manipulate gravity in real time to collect cubes within a time limit.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

This was developed as a demo/test project focused on implementing core mechanics for a gravity manipulation puzzle game using Unity.

## ðŸ›  Features

- Gravity manipulation in 6 directions
- Third-person character movement
- Sprinting, jumping, and smooth camera control
- Gamepad + keyboard support
- 2-minute timer & game over conditions
- Pause menu with full input support
- Clean, event-driven architecture
- Well-commented and modular code

## ðŸŽ® Controls

### Keyboard
- Move: `W/A/S/D`
- Jump: `Space`
- Sprint: `Left Shift`
- Gravity Direction: `Arrow Keys`
- Confirm Gravity: `Enter`
- Pause: `Escape`

### Gamepad
- Move: Left Stick
- Camera: Right Stick
- Jump: `A`
- Sprint: `B`
- Gravity Direction: D-Pad
- Confirm Gravity: `R1`
- Pause: `Start` / `Select`

## ðŸ“¦ Setup

1. Open in Unity (2021.3 LTS or newer)

2. Play in Editor or build for Windows/macOS

## ðŸ“„ Deliverables

- âœ… Full Unity project (shared via GitHub)
- âœ… Windows & Mac standalone builds
- âœ… Complete gameplay loop with win/loss conditions

## ðŸ§  Notes

- All assets/animations are from the provided base project.
- No external models or art used â€” focus was purely on development.
- Architecture emphasizes clean code, separation of concerns, and event-driven design.

## ðŸ“º Reference

Inspired by the concept shown [in this video](https://youtu.be/aLvoQsqdM50?t=132).
